== Operator Payout

The Operator is entitled to receive a payout for the commission and subscription charges that are applied to sellersâ€™ activities on the marketplace.

The Operator may choose not to receive their Operator fee, in which case their funds will be kept within the main funding account of the program in Hyperwallet. This can be configured in HMC properties as a toggle (on/off). See section 5.3.5 link:#enabling-or-disabling-the-operator-payout[+++Enabling or disabling the operator payout+++] below.

Only one marketplace operator exists for each instance of Mirakl. Setting up operator account Hyperwallet credentials in HMC will be handled manually. These details (including the program tokens and TRM tokens) should be provided to the Operator by the Hyperwallet team as part of the onboarding process.

Configuring operator payout details is described in section 2.3.1 link:#_heading=h.41mghml[+++Operator onboarding+++].

=== Data Requirements

* The Seller accounts should exist in Mirakl and be set up with one of the supported Bank Account payment methods and currencies, as described in 3.3 link:#_heading=h.19c6y18[+++Create/Update Seller Bank Account+++];
* Accounting documents (i.e. Invoices) should be created in Mirakl for the above sellers in order to trigger Payout feature.
* The Operator account should be created in Hyperwallet and relevant settings (user token, TRM) should be copied over to HMC properties.

=== Timed Job Frequency

Operator payout is processed as part of the same Payout job (_Extract Invoices_) as for the Seller Payout. See 5.2.4 in link:#_heading=h.4k668n3[+++Seller Payout+++] section.

=== Enabling or disabling the operator payout

The following Environment Variable can be used to enable or disable the payout of the operator commission into the operator's bank account (see README for further details such as format and default value):

* PAYPAL_HYPERWALLET_OPERATOR_COMMISSIONS_ENABLED

This setting is ON by default, meaning that the operator's commission will be paid to the corresponding bank account set up for the operator. If disabled, the commission will be kept within the main funding account of the program in Hyperwallet.
