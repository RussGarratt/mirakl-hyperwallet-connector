== Seller Payout

As per the Hyperwallet API spec, the TRM token (seller’s bank account) and programme token will be used to target the correct Seller account.

Seller accounts and bank accounts will be created automatically via HMC, as described in section 3 link:#_heading=h.3fwokq0[+++Seller onboarding+++]. No further configuration is required for HMC to enable Seller payout.

Payout is triggered through the _Extract Invoices_ job, which extracts eligible invoices from Mirakl and creates payment requests in Hyperwallet. This job handles both Seller and Operator payout.
