= KYC

== Overview

The Know Your Customer (KYC) process aims to verify customer accounts to ensure that the customers are genuinely who they claim to be. This involves verification of customer identity and, in the case of the Business Sellers, additional information about the business and its stakeholders.

KYC checks are mandatory in most countries that are the target market for Mirakl and Hyperwallet and so support for KYC processes exists on both platforms.

The Hyperwallet Mirakl Connector supports a managed flow for processing KYC verification, where seller details are added directly into a Hyperwallet-managed KYC form

The ‘KYC Status’ feature should be enabled in Mirakl in order to enable KYC processing. The operator should request this feature to be enabled by contacting Mirakl support.

== Managed KYC Flow

By default, HMC supports KYC verification via Hyperwallet-managed KYC forms. Please contact your Hyperwallet support team for instructions on how to conduct this process.

When the Hyperwallet platform sends KYC status update notifications, HMC will read these notifications and update the status on the relevant seller record(s) in Mirakl, thereby completing the KYC verification flow across Hyperwallet and Mirakl. See Section 4.3 “Update KYC Status” for more information about this process.

== Update KYC status

The Seller KYC status update will be received from HW via a webhook notification and updated on Mirakl as per the mapping below.

Note that there is a difference in the mapping for Individual and Business account types.

*Individual Account*

[width="100%",cols="32%,68%",options="header",]
|===
|HW KYC status |Mirakl KYC status
|UNDER_REVIEW |Awaiting KYC verification (PENDING_APPROVAL)
|VERIFIED |KYC Passed (APPROVED)
|REQUIRED |Awaiting KYC data (REFUSED)
|NOT REQUIRED |KYC Passed (Approved)
|===

*Business Account*

The 3 statuses from HW (_verificationStatus, businessStakeholderVerificationStatus, letterOfAuthorizationStatus_ ) will be compared to derive the overall KYC status updated in Mirakl.

The order of priority will be as follows, based on the following precedence rules:

* REQUIRED (most restrictive)
* UNDER REVIEW
* VERIFIED
* NOT_REQUIRED (least restrictive)

[width="100%",cols="45%,55%",options="header",]

When ALL of these statuses in HW: +
- verificationStatus +
- businessStakeholderVerificationStatus +
- letterOfAuthorizationStatus +
have reached at least:

|Mirakl KYC status
|NOT REQUIRED |KYC Passed (APPROVED)
|VERIFIED |KYC Passed (APPROVED)
|UNDER_REVIEW |Awaiting KYC verification (PENDING_APPROVAL)
|REQUIRED |Awaiting KYC data (REFUSED)
|===

== KYC Failure reason message

Upon updating KYC status if the status received from Hyperwallet is still REQUIRED, HMC will send a failure reason message to Mirakl to be displayed on the shop details page. Below are the possible failure messages depending on the type of notification received from Hyperwallet.
